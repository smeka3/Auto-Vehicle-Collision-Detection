# Auto-Vehicle-Collision-Detection
This repository implements a deep learning-based collision avoidance system for autonomous vehicles in dynamic traffic. The model predicts potential collisions in real-time, enabling safe navigation in complex environments and improving decision-making for autonomous vehicles in dynamic traffic scenarios.
