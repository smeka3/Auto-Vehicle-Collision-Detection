# Deep Learning-Based Collision Avoidance for Autonomous Vehicles in Dynamic Traffic Scenarios

## Abstract
This project explores the application of deep learning techniques in collision avoidance for autonomous vehicles, focusing on dynamic traffic scenarios. We aim to enhance the safety of self-driving cars by predicting and avoiding potential collisions using real-time traffic data.

## Problem Statement
Autonomous vehicles need to navigate complex and dynamic environments to ensure safety. In real-time traffic scenarios, predicting and preventing potential collisions is crucial to preventing accidents and ensuring the safety of the vehicle and its surroundings. This research focuses on the development of a deep learning model for collision avoidance in such environments.

## Methodology
We propose the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for collision prediction and avoidance in autonomous vehicles. The model is trained using a dataset of real-world traffic scenarios. It takes in real-time sensor data (e.g., camera, LiDAR) and makes predictions about the likelihood of potential collisions. The system then takes corrective actions to avoid the collisions based on these predictions.
